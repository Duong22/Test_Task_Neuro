# Test_Task_LD_Logic
- This is a solid test_task, if you can give candicates a test library or package for testing will be better.
- If not, I recommend you should give more details example, such as:

        with nv.listen(entities=['entity1', 'entity2']) as r:
            r.entity('entity1') # what will return? (and my idea is not type or description)
